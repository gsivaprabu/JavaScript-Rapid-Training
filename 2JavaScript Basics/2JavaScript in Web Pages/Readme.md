#JavaScript in Web pages

- <script> tag used for embedded the Javascript.
- src attribute located the JavaScript file.
- defer attribute to delay the loading a file.
- <noscript> tag used for whether the browser supports the JavaScript or not.

<script>
console.log('Hello');
</script>

- Best place to place the script is end of the <body> tag.
- Dont use defer not a good method
