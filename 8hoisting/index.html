        <li>Hoisting is unique to JavaScript</li>
        <li>Compiling in two passes</li>
        <ul>
            <li>All declaration are located and identifiers are known by the compiler</li>
            <li>Execution occurs in pass2 Because all variables are known from pass1,they may be accessed before they are declared</li>
            <li>The word hoisting is used to describe this behavior because it's as if the declaration are lifted (hoisted) to the top of the function before execution</li>
            <li>Hoisted variables are initialized to undefined</li>
        </ul>
